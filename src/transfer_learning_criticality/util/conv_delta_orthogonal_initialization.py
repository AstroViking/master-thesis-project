def conv_delta_orthogonal_(tensor, gain=1.):
    r"""Initializer that generates a delta orthogonal kernel for ConvNets.
    The shape of the tensor must have length 3, 4 or 5. The number of input
    filters must not exceed the number of output filters. The center pixels of the
    tensor form an orthogonal matrix. Other pixels are set to be zero. See
    algorithm 2 in [Xiao et al., 2018]: https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.05393
    Args:
        tensor: an n-dimensional `torch.Tensor`, where :math:`3 \leq n \leq 5`
        gain: Multiplicative factor to apply to the orthogonal matrix. Default is 1.
    Examples:
        >>> w = torch.empty(5, 4, 3, 3)
        >>> nn.init.conv_delta_orthogonal_(w)
